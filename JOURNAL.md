## 10/5/2025 - Schematic - Switch Matrix  

First time starting an electronics project with more hardware and depth such as using schematics, pcbs, e.t.c. Downloaded KiCAD and started learning how to use it while trying to create the switch matrix.

I struggled a little at the start to use KiCAD but I've been getting used to it. It's definitely pretty intuitive as you get the hang of it. Only thing I'm struggling with is identifying the different parts...

Overall good progress! I hope to be able to speed up how fast I work with KiCAD as I use it more and be able to develop more of my skills with it. Once I finish the main portion of the tutorial for the Midi Keyboard, I plan on coming back to add more depth and personalize the project.
