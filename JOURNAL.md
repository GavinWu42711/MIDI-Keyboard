## 10/5/2025 - Schematic - Switch Matrix  

First time starting an electronics project with more hardware and depth such as using schematics, pcbs, e.t.c. Downloaded KiCAD and started learning how to use it while trying to create the switch matrix.

I struggled a little at the start to use KiCAD but I've been getting used to it. It's definitely pretty intuitive as you get the hang of it. Only thing I'm struggling with is identifying the different parts...

Overall good progress! I hope to be able to speed up how fast I work with KiCAD as I use it more and be able to develop more of my skills with it. Once I finish the main portion of the tutorial for the Midi Keyboard, I plan on coming back to add more depth and personalize the project.

## 10/6/2025 - Schematic - Audio & Screen  

Added in the ST7735R LCD for the schematic and also the PCM5100 IIS DAC. I also added in an WS2812 5050 LED strip in the schematic. though that ended up using the last pin available. I want 3 octaves of keys while also have multiple buttons for various modes and an SD card to store .wav files if possible. I plan on looking into the SD card and a different microcontroller with more GPIO pins (likely something from the Raspberry Pi family so I can have both 5V and 3.3V).

Overall, I made okay progress. I plan on hopefully finishing up the schematic next time while also cleaning it up for visibility.

## 10/8/2025 - Schematic - Shift register  

Since I want the ability to add on other modules (or at least be able to do so more freely), I decided to change the rows in the switch matrix so they're connected to a SN74HC595 shift register. Since it has 8 outputs, it reduced the columns to 5 for a total of 40 buttons.

Based on the limited research I've done, it seems that immediately saving the music played as a .wav file would likely pose issues or be more tedious instead of giving the raw data to my computer to do the hard work. Because of this, (if I do try and save the music played), it would probably be the literal raw data of what was played in txt format or something adjacent that's easy to read and write from a Python standpoint.

Didn't get much progress done as I was looking into other modules and trying to figure out if the tutorial was missing anything in terms of the display potentially. On the same note, I'm considering switching it out for an LCD display. I'm more familiar with using it, and I feel it could better suit the needs of a Midi-keyboard given there isn't much graphical needed and more text/numbers that are necessary for settings.

Overall, I hope to be able to get more progress done next time!
