## 10/5/2025 - Schematic - Switch Matrix  

First time starting an electronics project with more hardware and depth such as using schematics, pcbs, e.t.c. Downloaded KiCAD and started learning how to use it while trying to create the switch matrix.

I struggled a little at the start to use KiCAD but I've been getting used to it. It's definitely pretty intuitive as you get the hang of it. Only thing I'm struggling with is identifying the different parts...

Overall good progress! I hope to be able to speed up how fast I work with KiCAD as I use it more and be able to develop more of my skills with it. Once I finish the main portion of the tutorial for the Midi Keyboard, I plan on coming back to add more depth and personalize the project.

## 10/6/2025 - Schematic - Audio & Screen  

Added in the ST7735R LCD for the schematic and also the PCM5100 IIS DAC. I also added in an WS2812 5050 LED strip in the schematic. though that ended up using the last pin available. I want 3 octaves of keys while also have multiple buttons for various modes and an SD card to store .wav files if possible. I plan on looking into the SD card and a different microcontroller with more GPIO pins (likely something from the Raspberry Pi family so I can have both 5V and 3.3V).

Overall, I made okay progress. I plan on hopefully finishing up the schematic next time while also cleaning it up for visibility.
